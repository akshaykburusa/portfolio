## Work Experience
**PhD Candidate @ Wageningen University and Research, The Netherlands (_Oct 2019 - Aug 2024_)**
- Addressed the challenge of occlusion, which is a major reason of failure for harvesting and de-leafing robots
- Developed active vision strategies that enabled robots to plan camera viewpoints that were occlusion-free and improved the efficiency and accuracy of perception
- Tested the active vision strategies in a tomato greenhouse and showed that it outperformed traditional methods

**Robotics Software Developer @ Geo-konzept GmbH, Germany (_Oct 2017 - Sep 2019_)**
- Applied autonomous vehicle and computer vision technology to agricultural and forestry applications
- Developed software to reconstruct 2D crop-quality map of farms by geometrically correcting and aligning multi-spectral drone images
- Developed a visual-inertial odometry algorithm to track the position of a wood harvesting vehicle under dense forest cover when GPS was unreliable
